        Parameters
        ----------
        vocab_size : int
            required to properly build square embedding layer, where each row corresponds to unique character
            from the vocabulary and each column -> "frequency" of the next character.

        Cross-Entropy expects to have features as the second-dimension, so we first need to
        transform logits in supported shape and in order to align targets tensor with logits tensor,
        we need to transform targets too.

        ----------
        logits : Tensor
            tensor with model's outputs

        ----------

        max_new_tokens : int
            number of characters to be generated
        temperature : float, optional
            The temperature determines how greedy the generative model is:
            If the temperature is low, the probabilities to sample other but the class with the highest log probability
            will be small, and the model will probably output the most correct text, but rather boring, with small
            variation.
            If the temperature is high, the model can output, with rather high probability, other words than those with
            the highest probability. The generated text will be more diverse, but there is a higher possibility of
            grammar mistakes and generation of nonsense.
