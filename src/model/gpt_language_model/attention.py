        Self-attention does these 6 steps:

        1. takes information from the token x
        2. encodes it into vectors key, query and value, where (intuitively):
            a. key - information of what the token has
            b. query - what the token is interested in
            c. value - if some token finds current token 'interesting' then this value should be used
        3. calculate attention scores by doing dot product between key and query
        4. [optional for decoder] creates triangular matrix that will help to mask tokens from the 'future', in other
        words token at position 4 should not communicate with token at position 5 and above, only with the previous
        tokens (3 and below)
        5. mask token from the 'future' with -inf value, which after softmax operation becomes 0
